# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Things are set up so that:

1. common operations are simple and easy to execute and hard to screw up
2. things rarely break
3. maintenence is rarely required
4. installation on a new computer is easy (there's a lot of work to do here)

I mostly use:

- nvim
- zsh
- kitty

#----------------------------------[ todos ]----------------------------------->
- handle setup stuff:
  - download `fzf`
- zsh:
    - fix function loading so I can use 'settex' from within vim
    - fix `fvim` command so that it outputs last line to commandline for repetition
