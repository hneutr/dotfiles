# dotfiles
Repeated actions should be easy.
Be consistent.
Name things reasonably.
Don't reimplement something you don't want to turn into a personal project.

# Tools:
- nvim
- tmux
- zsh

## Todos:
- all:
	- make it so that you can change the $SUFFIX seamlessly
	- figure out way to represent "things to do to migrate" for all things (eg iTerm2 option-->+Esc)
- vim:
	- general:
		- add in 'find to last in line' for f/F/t/T
		- think about the default vi bindings and what can be changed from vim
			- i.e. q has a lot of open real estate
		- learn about matchpairs
		- learn about more text-objects
		- possibly set viminfo settings?
	- plugins:
		- command/mappings to set source files based on filetypes
	- writing:
		- learn about 'spell'
			- how to add words
			- local to project (eg character names)
		- writing settings function:
			- make toggleable
- tmux:
	- use tmux plugins?
		- namely tmux-resurrect?
- inputrc:
	- learn more stuff
- iterm2:
- zsh:
	- move fzf into zsh/zplug, out of vim
