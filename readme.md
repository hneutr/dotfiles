	- general:
		- add in 'find to last in line' for f/F/t/T

		- think about the default vi bindings and what can be changed from vim
			- i.e. q has a lot of open real estate
		- learn about matchpairs
		- learn about ctrl-w
		- learn about more text-objects
		- possibly set viminfo settings?
		- autowrite/autowriteall not working? maybe because I use c-c to escape?
